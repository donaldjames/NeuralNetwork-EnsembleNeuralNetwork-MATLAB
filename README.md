# Neural Network and Ensemble Nueral Network
Created a CNN using MATLAB and used the breast cancer data for training and testing. Checked the network performance for LM, SCG and RP backpropagation algorithms and compared the result. Created an Ensemble Neural Network and compared it's performance.

Experiment 1
 setting the nodes [2 8 32] and epochs [4 8 16 32 64] and running the
 15 combinations 'iterate_count' of times. The average error rate,
 performance mean and standard deviation is calculated and stored into a
 multidimensional array for the ease of calculations
 
Experiment 2
 The node epoch combination with the lowest error rate is taken and
 do the random ensemble.

Experiment 3
 Compairing the training function 'trainscg', 'trainlm' and 'trainrp'.
